					<h3>The Road to the Segregated Witness</h3>
					<p>Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of <abbr title="Pay To Key Hash">P2KH</abbr>, 160bit hashes,
						no script versioning,
						and <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transaction_Malleability">transaction malleability</a>.</p>
					<p>We must clear the mind of the past. Bitcon's enlightenment has been achieved thanks to the tireless efforts of the Bitcoin Developers.</p>
					<p>The people of this workshop invite you to relax and meditate on the important lessons of the masters, begin to see with clarity, learn to use the time-honored techniques in new and invigorating fashion, and then: carefully consider using a Bitcoin Client that implements the BIP 148 standard.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="explanation" id="zen-explanation">
					<h3>So What is This About?</h3>
					<p>The Bitcoin Network has held hostage by those whom are paid to protect it. This workshop builds a tool for regualr users to reestablish their natural ability to decide how the Bitcoin Network should be run. <abbr title="User Activated Soft Forks">UASF's</abbr> allows users to coordinate and collectively force the miners into adopting new rules.</p>
					<p>BIP 148 works by making your Bitcoin client ignore any block that doesn't signal for SegWit between midnight August 1st 2017 and midnight November 15th 2017 (<abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr>). This will enable the natural activation of SegWit, as specified by the <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0009.mediawiki" title="BIP 9: Version bits with timeout and delay." target="new">BIP 9</a> protocol.</p>

						<h3>Participation</h3>
						<p>Upon meditation, you may decide to join us in our quest to activate Segregated Witness on the Bitcoin Network; in the process accreting that the Bitcoin Users hold the natural and rightful ownership over their own network. We suggest you <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/segregated-witness-part-how-a-clever-hack-could-significantly-increase-bitcoin-s-potential-1450553618/" title="Segregated Witness, Part 1: How a Clever Hack Could Significantly Increase Bitcoin's Potential | Bitcoin Magazine" target="new">research</a> about SegWit and <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/latest-twist-block-size-debate-called-uasf/" title="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/latest-twist-block-size-debate-called-uasf/" target="new">learn</a> how UASF's work.  Once you feel that you have a basic understanding.  Please consider to download and run versions of Bitcoin Software that implement the BIP 148 protocol.</p>
						<p>Your help on the Bitcoin Forums is also important; take part in the community, however be very strategic with your time and energy:  The forums are full of AI, <a href="https://99bitcoins.com/coin-fire-professional-bitcoin-trolls-exist/" title="Coin Fire+: Professional bitcoin Trolls Exist" target="new">paid trolls</a>, and <a href="#" title="A Closer Look at Reddit Vote Manipulation About Bitcoin | Bitcoin Magazine" target="new">vote manipulation</a>.</p>
						<p>If you are a developer, please consider to help with the development of the Bitcoin, possibly even encouraging and helping other Bitcoin projects to adopt BIP 148.</p>
