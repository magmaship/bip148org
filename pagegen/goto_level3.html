It is a link to <b>Community Content</b> - and on <b>other server</b>:<br/>
1) the content on <b>that page</b> is NOT provided by us. It is provided by other group (we expect them to be good,
how ever just saying it is not <a href="https://bip148.org/">our team</a>).

<p>Remember to <b>never run untrusted</b> programs!

<p>For Bitcoin builds please do check several sources, <b>demand a PGP signature</b> made by people you trust.</p>
<p>Check scripts before running them. Check git revision before building from source and running (how ever SHA1 revisions can be spoofed, safer to also save copy of the data, check SHA256 of all files).</p>
